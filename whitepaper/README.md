## 1. Introduction
Recent developments in artificial intelligence infrastructure—such as the $500 billion Stargate project aimed at building colossal centralized data centers—highlight the growing demand for compute power. However, while centralized data centers represent significant investments in physical infrastructure, they also centralize wealth and control, often leaving untapped resources and higher costs in their wake.

Cxmpute challenges this paradigm by proposing a decentralized approach that leverages idle compute resources worldwide. By distributing compute power across a global network, Cxmpute not only democratizes access to high-performance computing but also provides a sustainable and cost-competitive alternative to centralized cloud services.

## 2. Background and Motivation
Blockchain technology has long promised decentralization and transparency. Yet, in recent years, its public perception has been overshadowed by meme coins, NFTs, and speculative projects that rarely deliver real-world utility. The forced application of blockchain in domains like IoT and social media has often resulted in unnecessary complexity.

The advent of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) has re-energized interest in genuine, practical applications of decentralization. Cxmpute is born from this renewed focus, harnessing crypto and blockchain protocols to solve real-world problems in the compute infrastructure space. By tapping into idle global compute resources, Cxmpute paves the way for a robust, decentralized datacenter that aligns with both economic and technical imperatives.

## 3. The Cxmpute Vision
Cxmpute is envisioned as the world’s largest decentralized compute network. Its core tenets include:

- **Democratizing Compute Power:** Enabling anyone with eligible hardware to participate, earn rewards, and contribute to a global compute ecosystem.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** As more providers join the network, competition drives down prices, eventually making decentralized computing cheaper than traditional centralized cloud services.
- **Wealth Distribution:** Shifting economic benefits away from centralized corporations and distributing value among network nodes—each backed by physical compute infrastructure.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Supporting a broad range of compute services from virtual machines to serverless architectures, catering to varied hardware specifications and user needs.

## 4. Technical Architecture
Cxmpute is built on a robust, decentralized foundation that leverages the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and multi-chain compatibility to ensure scalability, security, and interoperability.

### 4.1 On-Chain Infrastructure
- **Frontend & Backend Hosting:**  
  The entire web application—including both frontend and backend components—is hosted on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). This ensures that the application is censorship-resistant, transparent, and decentralized from end to end.

- **Decentralized Storage (Stxrage):**  
  Cxmpute’s proprietary storage service, Stxrage, utilizes the ICP to provide secure, censorship-resistant file storage. This decentralized approach eliminates single points of failure and enhances data integrity.

### 4.2 Multi-Chain Compatibility
Thanks to ICP’s ability to make and receive HTTP requests, as well as support transaction signing, Cxmpute is inherently multi-chain. The platform supports all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks and other chains that utilize ECDSA signing, ensuring broad interoperability and a seamless user experience across various blockchain ecosystems.

### 4.3 Provider Setup & Operations
While key application processes such as user matching, signup, and compute requests are handled on-chain via ICP, provider-specific operations require dedicated local software. Providers participate in the network through the following steps:

- **Hardware Integration:**  
  Providers link their computing hardware to their Cxmpute account, ensuring seamless participation in the network.

- **Token Staking:**  
  To maintain network stability and trust, providers stake tokens as a commitment to quality and uptime.

- **Provision Creation:**  
  Providers set up individual Virtual Machines (VMs) or containers—referred to as provisions—that can be rented out or used for serverless compute.

- **Provision Activation:**  
  Providers configure the availability of their provisions (e.g., setting time limits or enabling indefinite access), which are then made live through the provider software. The provider software communicates securely with the on-chain backend via HTTP, ensuring that sensitive operations remain protected from potential security breaches.

## 5. Cxmpute Offerings
Cxmpute provides a comprehensive suite of compute services designed to meet diverse user and provider demands.

### 5.1 Compute Services

  The Cxmpute API (available at [api.cxmpute.xyz](https://api.cxmpute.xyz)) hosts a vast selection of models, providing a serverless AI inference service. Users can also host dedicated models for exclusive use.

- **Decentralized AI Archive:**  
  Beyond inference, models are available for download from a censorship-resistant archive, ensuring that AI innovations remain open and accessible.

- **Distributed AI Training:**  
  Utilizing Kubernetes-enabled infrastructure, Cxmpute facilitates large-scale machine learning workloads in a decentralized manner.

### 5.2 Agxnt: AI Agents-as-a-Service
In response to the rising interest in AI agents, Cxmpute introduces **Agxnt**—modular AI agents that users can integrate into workflows via the Cxmpute UI, API, or custom implementations. Providers host Agxnt engines to process requests ranging from simple tasks (e.g., generating presentations or videos) to specialized operations like AI-driven medical research.

**Available Agxnt Agents:**

- **Data & Memory:**  
  Write Memory, Search Memory, Ask Memory, Clear Memory, Delete Memory, Update Memory.

By leveraging these agents, users can replicate a vast majority of existing AI agent offerings and automate over 90% of digital workflows.

## 6. Pricing Model
Cxmpute’s flexible pricing model is designed to cater to both providers and users:

- **Provider-Determined Rates:**  
  Providers set their own price per compute unit/second for different service categories upon registration, allowing market dynamics to dictate cost-efficiency.

- **User-Specified Ranges:**  
  When deploying code to serverless compute or containers, users specify a price range that aligns with their budget and performance needs.

- **Dynamic Matching:**  
  Cxmpute’s system matches users with providers based on the specified parameters, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

- **Long-Term Rentals:**  
  Users have the option to rent containers or servers by the hour or month for applications that require consistent and reliable compute power.

## 7. Security and Decentralization
Cxmpute’s design prioritizes security and transparency:

- **On-Chain Operations:**  
  Critical functions such as user authentication, matching, and transaction processing are executed on the ICP, ensuring trustless and verifiable operations.

- **Decentralized Storage:**  
  With Stxrage, files are stored on-chain, mitigating risks associated with centralized data breaches or censorship.

- **Multi-Chain Security:**  
  The multi-chain support, particularly for EVM-compatible networks, leverages robust cryptographic standards (ECDSA signing) to maintain secure and tamper-resistant transactions.

- **Provider Software Safeguards:**  
  The provider-side operations communicate over secure HTTP channels, ensuring that sensitive information—such as hardware integration and token staking—is handled appropriately.
