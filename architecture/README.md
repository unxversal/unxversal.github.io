---

CXMPUTE will be fully hosted on-chain, ensuring a decentralized and robust infrastructure. Here's how it works:  

- **Frontend & Backend**: The entire web application, including both frontend and backend components, will be hosted on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).  
- **Decentralized Storage**: Cxmpute’s **Stxrage** service will leverage the Internet Computer Protocol for secure and censorship-resistant file storage.  
- **Multi-Chain Compatibility**: With ICP’s ability to make and receive HTTP requests and sign transactions, CXMPUTE will be seamlessly **multi-chain**, supporting all EVM-compatible networks and chains utilizing ECDSA signing.  
- **Core Processes on ICP**: Key functions such as **user matching, signup, and app operations** will run entirely on ICP, ensuring trustless execution and transparency. The only exceptions are provider-side operations, which require local software.  

#### **Provider Setup & Operations**  

To participate as a provider, users will need to install the **CXMPUTE Provider Software**, which facilitates:  

1. **Hardware Integration** – Linking their system to their provider account.  
2. **Token Staking** – Committing tokens to ensure network stability.  
3. **Provision Creation** – Setting up individual **VMs or containers** that can be rented or used for serverless compute.  
4. **Provision Activation** – Configuring availability settings (e.g., setting a time limit or enabling indefinite access).  

The **Provider Software** will automate most of this process while securely communicating with the app backend via HTTP. This ensures sensitive operations are handled efficiently, preventing potential security vulnerabilities.  

#### **Service Endpoints**  

CXMPUTE will expose dedicated endpoints for its core compute offerings:  

- **AGXNT** – AI Agents-as-a-Service  
- **INFXRENCE** – Decentralized AI inference  
- **SXRVERLESS** – Serverless compute and containers  

This architecture guarantees **scalability, security, and decentralization**, positioning CXMPUTE as a next-generation compute network.
